The RandomizedSound (_rnd, _rdm, _rand, _random, _randomize) type can be used to pick any child sound from a list of sounds.

It contains a list of Items and their names (as "keys") and the value of its probability.

The randomizer can be limited using the UnkByte value and UnkBytes Flags, which will limit the chosen items to the count.

Fields:

UnkByte - Unused. Restricts the randomization to a specified offset. (default 0 = no limit, 2 = first two items (FF FF) only, 3 = first three items (FF FF FF) only, etc)
UnkBytes - Flags corresponding to item count. When enabled, will correspond to the UnkByte value (1-2 items = FF, 3-4 = FF FF, 5-6 = FF FF FF, etc)

Example:

"tracks" picks randomly between "track_1", "track_2" and "track_3". Both "track_1" and "track_2" have a 100% probability of being chosen, while "track_3" has a 50% probability of being chosen.
