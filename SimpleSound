The SimpleSound (_ss, _simple) type is used to associate any other sound bock with a .wav sound file.

It is used to locate the container the sound file is located in, and the file itself. 

Like other sound types, it can have a Header section applied, which can be used to apply any of the Header variables to the initial sound. 

Fields:

ContainerName - metahash - the location of the container (.awc) and the container itself, for example, "resident/ambience" refers to ambience.awc.
FileName - metahash - the name of the file within the container, for example, "truck_door_open" refers to truck_door_open.wav.
WaveSlotNum - byte value - Unknown. Always set to 0.

Example:

"resident_ambience_scream_01" plays "scream_01.wav" from "ambience.awc" located in "resident.rpf".
