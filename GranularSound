The GranularSound type is used for granular engine sounds defined in VehicleEngineGranular entries in game.dat151.rel. 

It defines the engine & exhaust's acceleration, deceleration and idle sounds, as well as their individual volumes and the pitch vector for acceleration and deceleration.

Engine sounds are played from the engine bone of the vehicle model, while exhaust sounds are played from the exhaust bones. These can be coned out with individual controls for the volume.
Fields:
Wave1 - EngineAccel - engine acceleration sound and .awc location.
Wave2 - ExhaustAccel - exhaust acceleration sound and .awc location.
Wave3 - EngineDecel - engine deceleration sound and .awc location.
Wave4 -  ExhaustDecel - exhaust deceleration sound and .awc location.
Wave5 - EngineIdle - engine idle sound and .awc location.
Wave6 -  ExhaustIdle - exhaust idle sound and .awc location.
