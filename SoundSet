The SoundSet (_sounds) type is a set of sounds and their scripted application. 

Scripts call for the soundset, and then define the specific "script sound" to play. SoundSets can only be called for through script files or through game.dat151.

The data contains a list of items which refer to each script name and sound. Script names are pre-defined.

The order of items is in ScriptName hash alphanumeric order, for example, below, "stopsound" = 0x216A24CE (item 1), and "motorloop" = 0xD15B9729 (item 2).

It is important that individual sounds which are called for through a SoundSet in scripts use any of the "scripted" categories, for example, "scripted_louder".

Fields:

ScriptName - metahash - the script name called for in the script native.
SoundName - metahash - the sound that pairs up to the script name.

Example:

When "handlerforksdefault" is called for, "streamed_..._digger_stop" will play when "stopsound" is defined, and "streamed_..._digger_lifter" will play when "motorloop" is defined.

<Item type="SoundSet">
 <Name>handlerforksdefault</Name>

  <Flags value="0xAAAAAAAA" />
