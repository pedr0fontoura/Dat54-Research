The SoundSet (_sounds) type is a set of sounds and their scripted application. Scripts call for the soundset, and then define the specific "script sound" to play. 

The data contains a list of items which refer to each script name and sound. Script names are pre-defined.

Fields:

ScriptName - metahash - the script name called for in the script native.
SoundName - metahash - the sound that pairs up to the script name.

Example:

When "handlerforksdefault" is called for, "streamed_vehicles_box_van_1_digger_stop" will play when "stopsound" is defined, and "streamed_vehicles_box_van_1_digger_lifter" will play when "motorloop" is defined.

  <Item type="SoundSet">
   <Name>handlerforksdefault</Name>
   <Header>
    <Flags value="0xAAAAAAAA" />
