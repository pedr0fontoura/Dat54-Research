The "Unknown" (_map) sound type is used to map sounds to an AutomationSound type, which uses a MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) sound. 

The type can have numerous items which define specific note ranges of the MIDI, assigning them instruments or sounds individually.

The mapping will transpose the note range about middle C (C3).

Fields:

UnkData - Maps - Item list of mappings
	UnkByte0 - byte value - NoteMin - minimum note of this mapping
	UnkByte1 - byte value - NoteMax - maximum note of this mapping
	UnkByte2 - byte value - PitchLock - enables or disables single-key pitch change (setting to 1 will result in the entire MIDI playing as middle C (C3 - note 32), regardless of note.
	AudioTrack - metahash - Sound to play on this mapping.

It is important to note that the NoteMin value will transpose the MIDI about middle C (C3 - note 32) according to the value you set it at. 
For example, if the minimum note of your preferred range is note 37, setting a value of 37 will transpose the tune by 5 semi-tones (37-32 = 5). 
To correct the resulting pitch change of transposing, the note defined in the AudioTrack should have an opposing pitch change value which should correspond with the number of semi-tones.
For example, a transpose of +5 semi-tones should = -500, or 65035 pitch value to cancel out the change in pitch.)

Example:

Below, "merry_christmas_01_map" has two mappings:
	- notes 0 to 60 (C1 to C4) are assigned a jingle sound. These do not change pitch regardless of the MIDI notes.
	- notes 61 to 128 (D4 to G10) are assigned an organ sound.
